# check current branch and status
git status
git branch

# to test out new changes, create and switch to a new branch, let's say we call it "experimental"
# this will shift any future commits to "experimental" branch on this cloned repo
git checkout -b experimental

# Push the new branch to remove (-u --> links local to remote branch, so later dont have to continuously push to origin/experimental
git push -u origin experimental

# When a stable code is reached
git checkout main
git pull origin main
git merge experimental
git push origin main

# return back to experimental
git checkout experimental

# Keep "experimental" branch up-to-date
# in case "main" gets ahead...
git pull origin experimental
git merge main
# or
# git rebase main # cleaner

# delete a local branch that might not be needed anymore
git branch -d experimental
git push origin --delete experimental # deletes the remote branch



# --- Typical Workflow ---
main:         A -- B -- C ---- D
                    \        /
experimental:        E ---- F (something stable) ---- G ---- H

# --- rebase ---
1)
main:        A --- B --- C
                 \
experimental:      D --- E

2)
main:        A --- B --- C --- F
                 \
experimental:      D --- E

3)
main:        A --- B --- C --- F
                                   \
experimental (rebased):              D' --- E'
